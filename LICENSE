Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of "free" as in "free speech," not as in "free beer."
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These rules apply to all versions of the program, and it applies to any software that is modified or derived from it.
